== Fulcro Native Template

NOTE: For a template for use with Raw React Native CLI (not expo) see the `raw-native` branch of
this repository (updated 2023-09-29).

This repository is a work-in-progress.

This is a project that could be used as the basis for a
full-stack Fulcro native+web project where the logic
of the web and native apps is shared as much as possible.

This particular example shares login logic among the web
and native UIs, along with some basic routing.

In the interest of time, a tour of this project is
available on https://youtu.be/03I9uRxVQsc[YouTube].

== Prerequisites
Expo:
https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/

Clojure
https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure

=== Optional
Fulcro electron app for debugging mobile app (fulcro inspector)
https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-inspect#using-the-fulcro-3x-electron-app

React devtools
https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/debugging/#debugging-with-react-devtools

Clj-kondo config for fulcro, mount and pathom
https://gist.github.com/gmp26/2d2a8fafa0650c80af5d79c8e2929c34

Fulcro-native library (read may be useful)
https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-native

== Basic Usage

IMPORTANT: By default native app will try to connect to Electron Fulcro Inspect.
You may comment out the app.inspect-native-preload in `shadow-cljs.edn` to disable this.

NOTE: Logging errors in the Native env will show
an error screen on the app. Just press ESC to
continue in the simulator if that happens.



In one terminal, start up CLJS build:

```
$ yarn
$ npx shadow-cljs server
```

Go to http://localhost:9630/dashboard and
click on Builds, and check the native
and web builds (you should see both of them
build).

Make sure you have the clojure CLI tools
installed, and in a 3rd terminal start a REPL:

```
$ clj -A:dev
user=> (restart)
```

You should see a message about starting.

Open http://localhost:3000. This is the webapp.

For mobile version
In another terminal, start up expo:

```
$ cd mobile
$ yarn
$ npx expo start
```

Go to the Expo terminal window and press 'i'
(requires XCode and Simulator to be installed).

An iPad/Phone simulator should start with the app.

There is a demo login account of "user"/"letmein".

== Usage on Android

If using Android you must use a patched version of sente and specify the host for Electron Fulcro Inspect.

Update `deps.edn` to use the patched version of sente

```
org.clojars.currentoor/sente        {:mvn/version "1.14.1-SNAPSHOT"}
com.fulcrologic/fulcro              {:mvn/version "3.1.8"
                                    :exclusions  [com.taoensso/sente]}
```

Update `shadow-cljs.edn` to connect to inspect on the host machine which is always 10.0.2.2 on the Android Studio emulator

```
:closure-defines  {'goog.DEBUG                  true
                                             app.client-native/SERVER_URL "http://10.0.2.2:3000/api-native"
                                             com.fulcrologic.fulcro.inspect.inspect_ws/SERVER_PORT 8237
                                             com.fulcrologic.fulcro.inspect.inspect_ws/SERVER_HOST "10.0.2.2"}
```

== Expo local modules
In order to use a local module (assuming you already have one, if not, follow https://docs.expo.dev/modules/get-started/[this] to create an example module), you will need to make some modifications to the current template. For more details on all of the changes, have a look at https://github.com/aratare-jp/fulcro-native-template/commit/4802283b286df353d337cbff40032497bb42ef13[this commit], but TL;DR:

1. Follow the above section if you're working with Android.
2. `shadow-cljs.edn` needs to have `:output-dir "mobile/index"` within the `:native` build. This is because Expo automatically checks for this directory and will automatically fail without it. A dummy `index.js` doesn't work properly with blank screen, so your best bet is to change the output dir itself).
3. `app.json` needs `"android": { "package": "com.example.fulcro" }`
for Android, and `"ios": { "supportsTablet": true, "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.fulcro" }` for IOS.
4. Follow https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/absolute-path-expo-modules.md[this].
5. `mobile/package.json` needs to have `"main": "index/index.js"`

Now the app should build as expected.

https://someurl[Here] is an example of a working build with a local module `CatGif` that simply returns a random URL that can be called within `mobile_ui/root.cljs` to show some cat gif!

== Debugging mobile app
Just start fulcro electron app, after running your mobile app.
It should work out of the box.
If you have problem connecting try "r" in expo mobile app menu or restarting the mobile simulator

For react-native in separate tab run:
`yarn run react-devtools`

And hit "r" in expo menu to refresh app and after that press "m" for debug options.
This should connect react-devtools to your app.

== Possible problems
If you are getting errors while starting expo app
make sure that mobile/app directory exists.
If not, running npx shadow-cljs server and building should help.

Iphone simulator is black:
Just close iphone simulator device
and hit "i" in expo menu to reopen iphone (sometimes works after third try)

Warn/error when opening expo app on mobile simulator / Can't see the app
Click Minimize to see the application.

WARN [taoensso.sente] - Chsk is closed: will try reconnect
This happens when fulcro-inspect-electron is not connected
As stated above:
You may comment out the app.inspect-native-preload in `shadow-cljs.edn` to disable this.
